# Data Structures and Algorithms Solved Problems in Java

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of solved problems in Java focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each problem is meticulously solved and optimized to demonstrate efficient coding practices and understanding of core concepts in computer science.

## Contents
1. **Arrays and Strings**
   - Implementation of dynamic arrays
   - String manipulation techniques

2. **Linked Lists**
   - Singly linked list operations
   - Doubly linked list operations

3. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Stack operations (push, pop, peek)
   - Queue operations (enqueue, dequeue)

4. **Trees**
   - Binary tree traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder)
   - Binary search tree operations (insertion, deletion)

5. **Graphs**
   - Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms
   - Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford)

6. **Sorting and Searching**
   - Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort
   - Merge sort, quicksort
   - Binary search algorithm

7. **Dynamic Programming**
   - Fibonacci sequence calculation
   - Knapsack problem

## Usage
Each problem solution is organized into separate Java classes within appropriate packages. The code is well-commented to explain the logic behind each solution and its time complexity considerations.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/VineetOS/data-structures-algorithms-java.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Problem Folder:**
   ```
   cd data-structures-algorithms-java/ProblemName
   ```

3. **Compile and Run:**
   ```
  Every Program has a main function, so you can directly run it.
   ```
